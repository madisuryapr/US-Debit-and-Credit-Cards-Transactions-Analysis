# US Personal Debit and Credit Cards Transactions Database

This repository presents The US personal debit and credit cards transactions database. I engineered Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process by employing Tableau Prep Builder
for 15+ Million debit and credit cards transactions, alongside 1000+ users. I designed and devised this database by utilizing and integrating Microsoft SQL Server and DataGrip.
Furthermore, this repository also includes all SQL queries in devising the database, as well as analyzing the data in order to gain various insights. Additionally, when it comes
to Data cleansing and wrangling, I employed Microsoft Excel's well-known feature, namely Power Query.
