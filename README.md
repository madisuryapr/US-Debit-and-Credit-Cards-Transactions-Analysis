# US Personal Debit and Credit Cards Transactions Database

This repository presents The US personal debit and credit cards transactions database. I engineered Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process by employing Tableau Prep Builder
for 15+ Million of Rows of debit and credit cards transactions, alongside 1000+ users. I designed this database by utilizing Microsoft SQL Server and DataGrip for creating database design.
Furthermore, this repository also includes all SQL queries in devising the database, as well as analyzing all data in order to gain various insights.
