# Exploring Transactions Data with CASE Statement
In this folder, I demonstrate how to utilize CASE statement to gain diverse insights regarding debit and credit cards transactions
for several business-related questions. By employing CASE statement, we are able to answer the questions with certain criteria,
such as "How Many Users of debit cards based on their FICO Score's rating?". Furthermore, it is also important to be taken into
consideration that aggregate functions are able to be inserted within CASE statement, this includes SUM, MIN, MAX, and AVG.
